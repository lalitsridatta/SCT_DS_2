🛳️ Titanic EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis
This project is part of my internship tasks at Skill Craft Technology. It focuses on exploring the Titanic dataset to discover trends and insights related to passenger survival.

📂 Dataset
Source: Seaborn Titanic Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data?select=test.csv)

Contains demographic and travel details of passengers on the Titanic, along with their survival status.

🧠 Objectives
Understand the distribution of passenger ages.

Explore how gender affected survival rates.

Visualize relationships between age and fare.

📊 Visualizations Included
Age Distribution: Histogram showing how passenger ages are spread.

Survival by Gender: Count plot comparing survival between male and female passengers.

Age vs Fare Scatter Plot: Visualizes the relationship between age and fare across passengers, possibly highlighting survival clusters.

🔍 Key Insights
Most passengers were in the 20–40 age range.

Women had a significantly higher survival rate than men.

Higher fares were often associated with younger passengers and increased survival chances.
